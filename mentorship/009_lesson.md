/*
Factory vs Constructor

What is a factory?
Returns an object without `new`

What does `new` do?
1. Instantiates the new object and binds `this` to it.
2. binds instance.__proto__ to Constructor.prototype
3. binds instance.__proto__.constructor to Constructor
4. implicitly returns `this`

What does this have to do with `instanceof`?

How does `instanceof` work?

`instanceof` lies. What does that mean?

False negatives. Prototype link could change. Constructor.prototype could change, or instance.__proto__ could change. Either could create false negtavies or false positives.

`instanceof` fails across iframes (or anything that creates a new memory realm): why?

/*
What is a functional mixin?

Create composite objects without base classes or class inheritance.

Problems with functional mixins:
* Can create class hierarchies if you think in terms of is-a thinking instead of composing from multiple indendent sources
* Implicit dependencies - a functional mixin that depends on the presence of another functional mixin.
* Potential for clashing functional mixins (e.g., key collisions, dependencies on specific behaviors or object structure)

Alternatives:
Regular module imports
Small, pure functions

Good use-cases:
* Build up and compose composite data structures (useful for reducers, application state transitions, etc.) - alternatively, try lenses
* Attaching derived generic methods (map, flatMap, etc.) to data structures
