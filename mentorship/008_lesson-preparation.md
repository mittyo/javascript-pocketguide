* It takes 30% longer to build-out projetc with TDD
* TDD reduces production bug density 40%-80%
* Fixing a production bug costs 100x more than fixing a bug at design time
* Each context switch can cost up to 20 minutes of developer productivity
* An interrruped task takes about twice as long to complete and contains twice as many errors as an uninterrupted task. (see [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
