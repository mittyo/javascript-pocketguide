Object Composition

What is an object?

A composite datatype consisting of primitive data types and/or other objects.

What is object composition?

The act of composing objects (and/or primitive values) to produce a composite object. P.S. All objects are composites, so by extension, all object creation is composition.


What is class inheritance?

Creates parent/child is-a relations where the child inherits every property of the base class. Class inheritance is a form of composition, however, it leads you conceptually away from the idea of assembling smaller parts to form a larger whole, and towards the idea of creating is-a relations where the child gets everything from a single, monolithic source.

"Favor composition over class inheritance" means that you should think in terms of assembling smaller pieces rather than inheriting everything from a single monolith.


Types of object compositon:

* Aggregation
* Concatenation
* Delegation

## What is Aggregation?

An object which is made up of an enumerable collection of contained objects which each retain their own identity.

Examples:
* Graphs
* Trees
* Arrays

## Concatenation

Combining multiple objects into one such that the source objects do not retain their own identity. Instead, properties from each object are mixed-in to the new object.

Examples:
* Redux reducers can apply state changes by mixing new values into an existing state object
* Extending data structures with lose property definitions (like in a NoSQL database)

Counter examples:
* Accidental mutations of shared mutable state (mutating a delegate prototype used by other objects)


## Delegation

Forwarding (delegating) property lookup to another object.
